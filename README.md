Pi-hole Logger
============
Based on [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE) DNS-based adblocking software for the Raspberry Pi, this fork maintains the adblocking capability while adding the ability to parse and display syslog from other log sources.

The goal of the project is to add support for multiple types of syslog with parsing, searching, and reporting/alerting capabilities.
