        <li>Load: load averages for the last minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. A load average of 1 reflects the full workload of a single processor on the system. We show a red icon if the current load exceeds the number of available processors on this machine (which is <?php echo $nproc; ?>)</li>
        <li>Memory usage: Shows the percentage of memory actually blocked by applications. We show a red icon if the memory usage exceeds 75%</li>

    <h2>Main page</h2>
    <p>On the main page, you can see various Pi-hole statistics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Summary: A summary of statistics showing how many total DNS queries have been blocked today, what percentage of DNS queries have been blocked, and how many domains are in the compiled ad list. This summary is updated every 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Queries over time: Graph showing DNS queries (total and blocked) over 10 minute time intervals. More information can be acquired by hovering over the lines.</li>
        <li>Query Types: Identifies the types of processed queries:
            <ul>
                <li>A: address lookup (most commonly used to map hostnames to an IPv4 address of the host)</li>
                <li>AAAA: address lookup (most commonly used to map hostnames to an IPv6 address of the host)</li>
                <li>PTR: most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups</li>
                <li>SRV: Service locator (often used by XMPP, SIP, and LDAP)</li>
                <li>and others</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Query Types: Shows to which upstream DNS the permitted requests have been forwarded to.</li>
        <li>Top Domains: Ranking of requested sites by number of DNS lookups.</li>
        <li>Top Advertisers: Ranking of requested advertisements by number of DNS lookups.</li>
        <li>Top Clients: Ranking of how many DNS requests each client has made on the local network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Query Log</h2>
    <p>Shows the recent queries by parsing Pi-hole's log. It is possible to search through the whole list by using the "Search" input field. If the status is reported as "OK", then the DNS request has been permitted. Otherwise ("Pi-holed") it has been blocked. By clicking on the buttons under "Action" the corresponding domains can quickly be added to the white-/blacklist. The status of the action will be reported on this page.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <h2>White- / Blacklist</h2>
    <p>Add or remove domains (or subdomains) from the white-/blacklist. If a domain is added to e.g. the whitelist, any possible entry of the same domain will be automatically removed from the blacklist and vice versa. Adding wildcards using the web UI is currently <em>not</em> supported.</p>

    <h2>Update Lists</h2>
    <p>Runs the command <pre>sudo pihole -g</pre> and prints the result transparently to the web UI. The gravity.sh script will update the list of ad-serving domains</p>

    <h2>Query adlists</h2>
    <p>Runs the command <pre>sudo pihole -q <i>searchstring</i></pre> and prints the result transparently to the web UI. This command can be used to scan for strings in the list of blocked domains, e.g., &quot;analytics&quot; will deliver all domains which contain *analytics*, where the asterisk (*) represents a number of characters or an empty string</p>
